# Machine Learning Data Scinece Practice

Welcome! This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, images and other materials related to my personal Data Science Practice 

## What this Repo focuses on

1. Create a framework for working through problems of Machine Leaning and Data Science
2. Find tools to fit the framework
3. Targeted practice = use tools and framework steps to work on end-to-end machine learning modelling projects 


* Section 1 - Getting your mind and computer ready for machine learning (concepts, computer setup)
* Section 2 - Tools for machine learning and data science (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
* Section 3 - End-to-end structured data projects (classification and regression)
* Section 4 - Neural networks, deep learning and transfer learning with TensorFlow 2.0
* Section 5 - Communicating and sharing your work
